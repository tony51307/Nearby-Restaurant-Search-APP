# Nearby-Restaurant-Search-APP

After finishing the IOS Programming course, I decided to practice what I learned by building an IOS APP on my own. Since I realized everyday I spent quite some time searching for the restaurant to eat, I decided to create an APP that can help me quickly capture all nearby restaurants.

Key Features of the APP:
1. Get the restaurant data through Google Map SDK
2. Able to adjust search area distance
3. Able to order the results by ratings and distance
4. Could Google Map to show the locations of user and restaurants
5. Able to view the reviews of the resturants on Google Map
6. Able to make a call by simply clicking on the phone number
7. Able to add restaurants into Like List
